# Project1
The Birthday Tracker app allows you to track as many birthdays as you wish, regardless of where you sign in, along with sending reminders as the big day approaches, and suggestions for gift ideas based on the interests of your friend or loved one.  
Just enter in your name, email, and the recipient's information on the front page and it will be added to a permanent list.  Look for an email in your inbox when you sign up and again as the birthday you're tracking approaches.  When you click "view gift" next to the person's name you'll be taken to a page with three gift suggestions based on the "like" you entered on the first page.
